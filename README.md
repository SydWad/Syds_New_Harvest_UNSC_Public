This mod is a continuation of the [original New Harvest mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1797089215) by [Elliot](https://steamcommunity.com/id/badrabbit49).  
Most sprites and sounds are credited to him.

The weapon fabricator and ammo fabricator sprites come from [Enhanced Armaments](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2764968387), credit to [SCP-966-1](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198260494560).

Special thanks to [TJ](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198790487416) and [his server](https://discord.gg/CFmtZDNWND) for helping test the mod. This project wouldn't have been possible without their support.
